# **AUTO-Trader powered by Agentic AI **  

## **Overview**  
This application leverages **OpenAI's Agent SDK** and a suite of specialized AI agents to support various tasks, including **File Search, Web Search, Tools Integration, Handoffs, and Developer Efficiency Agents**. It enhances sales assistance, financial analysis, and code/documentation generation for structured files like JSON and SQL stored procedures.  

### **Project Purpose**  
This application serves as a hands-on exploration of OpenAI's Agent SDK in real-world use cases. While functional, there are opportunities for improvement—particularly in optimizing `*.FileVector.py` to handle multiple files within a directory. Future enhancements will focus on refining this capability, making it a key aspect of the project's evolution.
